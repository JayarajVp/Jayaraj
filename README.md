## Research paper
Analyzing Security Vulnerabilities in Mobile Browsers: Risks and Exploits.

Introduction: With the increasing use of mobile devices, mobile browsers have become a major target for cyber threats such as phishing, MITM attacks, and tracking exploits. In this study, I examine vulnerabilities in popular mobile browsers through penetration testing and case studies. The results reveal significant security weaknesses, exposing users to potential cyber risks. To address these issues, I propose a security-enhancing solution that improves protection against emerging threats, ensuring safer browsing experiences.
